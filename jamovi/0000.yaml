  This module allows you to perform multivariate exploratory analyses the french
  way. In other words, you will be able to add supplementary information for a
  better understanding of your results. Three main methods have been
  implemented:  Principal Component Analysis, Correspondence Analysis and
  Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Results are obtained thanks to the
  FactoMineR package.
